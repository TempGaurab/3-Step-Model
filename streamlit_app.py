The proposed system uses a three-model approach for driver drowsiness detection, where the first model activates only when the car is running and checks for a person in the driver's seat. When a person is detected, the second model locates the driver's eyes and sends these images to a custom-built third model. The third model analyzes eye features to detect drowsiness, potentially triggering various alert mechanisms like intermittent braking or honking if the driver appears to be sleeping.
